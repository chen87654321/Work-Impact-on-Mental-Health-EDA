# Work Impact on Mental Health: An EDA Project

## Summary

This is my first time creating an EDA project. It was completed as an evaluation after finishing the Pandas course.

The dataset used is synthetic data from a self-reporting survey about mental and physical health issues across different work arrangements.

### In this project, I explored connections between:

1. Different work arrangements and burnout levels  
2. Different work arrangements and levels of social isolation  
3. The impact of social isolation on reported mental health  
4. The number of physical health issues reported in each work arrangement  
5. The relationship between the number of physical health issues and reported mental health  

At the end of the project, conclusions and recommendations are provided.

## Learning in DataCamp

Learning on the DataCamp website taught me the skills I needed to turn this project into reality.

From basic programming (Introduction to Python), through more advanced topics (Pandas), and data visualization (Matplotlib, Seaborn, and Plotly Express), the courses provided a clear learning path.

DataCamp also includes code-along videos demonstrating how an EDA project is structured, which helped me understand not only how to write the code, but also how to extract insights and present an analysis.
